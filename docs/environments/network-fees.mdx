# Network Fees

Nevermined provides the infrastructure to content creators and users to negotiate around their digital assets in a secure a trustless manner. All the software required to make that happen is offered under an Open Source License. 

To continue to provide this service, the Nevermined Smart Contracts charge a **1 % fee** for the monetary transactions happening through them. This means when a user sell for example a NFT, in the distribution of rewards, this fee needs be included.


:::info

There is no a minimum fee required, so if the asset is being traded for free, it's not necessary to include any payment.

## How to setup the network fees?

To execute a transaction using the Nevermined Smart Contracts it is necessary to include in the rewarsd payment a comission that is given to the **Nevermined Fee Receiver**.

This typically can be done when a content creator defines how to payments are distributed during the asset registration.

```js

// Nevermined Fee receiver address in testnet environments
const nvmFeeReceiverTest = '0x309039F6A4e876bE0a3FCA8c1e32292358D7f07c'

// Nevermined Fee receiver address in production environments
const nvmFeeReceiverProd = '0x35aFA2408BB4f479996fafb2bB3A183ec064C265'

const assetRewards = new AssetRewards(
    new Map([
        [creatorAddress, nvmFeeReceiverProd],
        [198, 2] // 99% of the payment goes to the `creatorAddress` and 1% to `nvmFeeReceiverProd`
    ])
)

// We register a NFT-721 Asset using the payment distribution defined in the `assetRewards` variable
const assetDDO = await nevermined.assets.createNft721(
    metadata,
    artist,
    assetRewards,
    'PSK-RSA',
    nft.address,
    token.getAddress(),
    true,
    [],
    royaltyAttributes
)

```
