# Nevermined Public Environments

This section provides links and information regarding the different public environments where Nevermined is deployed and can be used.

## About the tags

Tags are different contract deployments for the same network&version. Each tag is independant from the others. Generically we use two different tags:

- `public`: This tag/contracts instane is meant to be used for new integrations, public integrations, etc... It expected to have the latest versions and/or configurations. This is a *shared* environment. *Probably you need to use these environments.*

- `common`: This tag/contracts instane is used by more "stable" applications. Each application has its own nevermined stack (`gateway` + `markeplace-api`).
