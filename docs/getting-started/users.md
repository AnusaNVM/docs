description: Who can use Nevermined
---
Nevermined is designed by Web3 builders for Web3 builders. Those who are working with digital assets and NFT technology, but want to add advanced utility to these assets. 

In other words, every Web3 developer. ðŸ˜‚

Maybe youâ€™re building a platform, a dApp, a marketplace or a DAO. 
Maybe you work directly for an Asset Creator (a musician, a data team, a real estate company,...), whoâ€™s looking for new ways to create value with their assets. 

Building on Nevermined will give you the benefit of being able to integrate production-ready and hardened components into your stack and your existing smart contracts. 

Currently, Nevermined is available in two ways, for different development approaches: 
- All advanced functionalities are available via our [SDK](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/nevermined-sdk/getting-started/ "SDK")
- For apps made in React, we have functionalities available as a [Catalog](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/catalog/intro/ "Catalog").

Weâ€™re also working on packaging our components in SaaS-solutions.
